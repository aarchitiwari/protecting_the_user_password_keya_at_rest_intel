1. Application Workflow
User Selects File/Directory: The user chooses a file or directory to encrypt.
Generate File Encryption Key (FEK): The application generates a random File Encryption Key (FEK) using a secure random number generator.
Encrypt File/Directory: The selected file or directory is encrypted using AES-256 with the FEK.
User Sets Passphrase: The user sets a passphrase that will protect the FEK.
Derive Key from Passphrase: The passphrase is processed through a Key Derivation Function (KDF) to generate a key.
Encrypt FEK: The FEK is encrypted using the key derived from the user's passphrase.
Store Encrypted FEK: The encrypted FEK is stored in a secure file.
Authenticate User: When the user wants to decrypt the file/directory, they provide their passphrase.
Decrypt FEK: The passphrase is used to derive the key, which is then used to decrypt the FEK.
Decrypt File/Directory: The decrypted FEK is used to decrypt the file or directory.
2. High-Level Algorithm
Encryption Phase:

Generate a random FEK.
Encrypt the selected file or directory using AES-256 with the FEK.
Derive a key from the user passphrase using a KDF (e.g., PBKDF2).
Encrypt the FEK with the derived key using AES-256.
Store the encrypted FEK in a secure file.
Decryption Phase:

Prompt the user for the passphrase.
Derive the key from the passphrase using the same KDF.
Decrypt the FEK using the derived key.
Decrypt the file or directory using the decrypted FEK.
3. Justification for Crypto Algorithms
AES-256: Provides a high level of security and is a widely accepted standard for symmetric encryption.
Key Derivation Function (KDF) - PBKDF2: Enhances security by making brute-force attacks more difficult. It uses a passphrase, salt, and iteration count to produce a secure key.
Secure Random Number Generator: Ensures the FEK is unpredictable and secure.
4. Open Source and System Routines
Cryptography Library: Use libraries such as cryptography in Python, which provides implementations for AES and PBKDF2.
Secure File Handling: Use standard file I/O operations in Python, ensuring proper permissions and handling.
Random Number Generation: Use os.urandom or secrets module in Python for generating the FEK.
5. Test Plan
Basic Functionality Tests:

Encrypt and decrypt a small text file.
Encrypt and decrypt a large directory.
Edge Cases:

Empty file/directory encryption and decryption.
Very large file encryption and decryption.
Special character handling in file names.
Security Tests:

Attempt to decrypt with an incorrect passphrase.
Check for passphrase and FEK not being stored in plain text.
Performance Tests:

Measure time taken to encrypt and decrypt large files and directories.
Measure performance with varying passphrase lengths.
